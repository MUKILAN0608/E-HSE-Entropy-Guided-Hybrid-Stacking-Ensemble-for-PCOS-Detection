# -E-HSE-Entropy-Guided-Hybrid-Stacking-Ensemble-for-PCOS-Detection
This project implements an Entropy-Guided Hybrid Stacking Ensemble (E-HSE) framework for accurate and explainable Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) detection. The model combines advanced machine learning techniques with dual explainability mechanisms to provide clinically interpretable predictions.
